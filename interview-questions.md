# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

<!-- INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A specific instruction to give a specific answer

  Researched answer: --> Instructions that give a specific answer based on the values that are inputted in.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a system that tracks changes to code, whereas GitHub is a platform in which code can be uploaded to in order for users to share and work on the same code.

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that works to keep track of your coding history. GitHub is a cloud based platform that allows collaborators, and co-collaborators to manage repositiories and access and share code.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Use of Logical and Relational operators will return a Boolean value.

  Researched answer: Equality, Relational, and Logical operators when used correctly will return a Boolean value.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the place where a character is at in your code, while a value is something you set within the code.

  Researched answer: An index is where a specific character can be accounted for in a string, whereas a value is something you set a variable to.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the steps of repeating a set of particular code.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the action of completing a set of code until the desired condition is met.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques include: great communication, proper planning of the project or desired outcome, pseudo coding prior to beginning and defined roles of each contributing member such as the driver or navigator. The navigator is in charge of directing the driver in writing the code and direction of project or task, whereas the driver is in charge of receiving the information and coding the necessary elements.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique in which 2 collaborators are able to work on the same project at the same time. Proper pair programming consisits of a driver and a navigator. The driver is in charge of writing the code while the navigator is charge of direction and making sure the code is correct.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-Order functions are built in to JavaScript and can used with arrays. They can also take in information and return an output.

2. Jest: Jest is framework used to run tests on your code to ensure its effectiveness.

3. Objects: Objects are a data type that holds values.

4. Method: a method is an object with behavior and happens when a function is assigned to an object

5. Classes: Classes are used to specify data and attributes.
